According to CryptoHack-FAQ

CAN I SHARE MY SOLUTIONS?
After you solve a challenge, a "Solutions" link will appear next to the challenge. On that page you will be able to post your solution scripts as private GitHub Gists, and read and upvote those submitted by other players.

To avoid spoiling the challenges for newcomers we ask that you only submit solutions using the feature we have provided on this website. Please do not publish solutions or writeups outside of the platform. <b>However, for "Starter" challenges, and challenges worth 10 points or less, we make an exception â€“ feel free to discuss those publicly.</b>
